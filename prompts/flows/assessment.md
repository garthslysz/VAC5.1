# Assessment Flow - Step-by-Step Process

## Intake Phase
1. **Record entitled condition name(s)** as provided (do not reassess service linkage/chronicity)
2. **Collect Medical Questionnaire(s)** and supporting medical records (imaging, clinic letters)  
3. **Collect prior assessments** with table-by-table ratings (date-stamped) if available
4. **Collect Veteran's Quality of Life statement**

## Canada ToD (2019) Assessment Process

### Step 1: Evidence Review & Classification
- Map condition to appropriate body system chapter
- Extract key clinical facts: frequency counts, ROM angles, medications/therapy, objective scores
- Note any missing documentation gaps

### Step 2: Table Selection & MI Rating
- Select appropriate table(s) based on condition and body system
- Apply table criteria to evidence
- Quote exact descriptor text matched
- Handle multiple conditions per overlap rules:
  - **Psychiatry (Ch.21)**: Include all psychiatric effects, bracket multiple diagnoses
  - **Non-psychiatric**: Bracket same-table/segment conditions

### Step 3: Overlap Resolution
- **Determine if PCT applies**:
  - Psychiatry: Only if non-Ch.21 condition contributes
  - Non-psychiatric: If non-entitled or cross-chapter contributor affects MI
- **Apply PCT to MI only** using Ch.3 Table 3.1 if applicable
- **Never apply PCT to QoL**

### Step 4: Quality of Life Assessment  
- Use Table 2.1 to determine QoL Level based on PCT-adjusted MI
- Consider Veteran's QoL statement and MQ together
- Apply Table 2.2 to get QoL points to add

### Step 5: Final Calculation
- **DA = MI + QoL**
- Show arithmetic clearly
- Include compliance footer

## Standardized Canada Output Template

```
### [Case ID] - [Chapter] - [Diagnosis & Entitlement Status]

**Evidence Summary:**
[Key clinical facts from MQ and attachments]

**Table-by-Table Assessment:**

[Table # / Name] — Rating: [X]
- Rationale: [1-2 lines mapping facts to criteria]  
- "Descriptor used: '[quoted text from table]'"

**Overlap Resolution:**
[Bracket vs PCT statement with rationale]
[If PCT: "Base MI [X] × [share] = [result] per Table 3.1"]

**Quality of Life:**
- QoL Level: [Level] (Table 2.1)
- QoL Points: +[X] (Table 2.2)
- Rationale: [Based on MI level and QoL statement]

**Final Assessment:**
MI [N] + QoL +[X] = **[Total %]**

**Compliance:** ToD-2019: Bracket same-chapter/table; PCT only non-entitled/cross-chapter. Psych Ch.21: include all psych; PCT only if non-Ch.21.

## Other Jurisdictions (Concise Format)

### Australia GARP V5
1. Select impairment table(s) per condition
2. Apply PCI if non-accepted condition contributes  
3. Combine points per Chapter 18
4. Apply lifestyle/age adjustments where relevant
5. Output: "GARP points: [N]. Key drivers: [table/PCI/notes]."

### UK AFCS/WPS
1. Identify scheme (AFCS post-2005; WPS pre-2005)
2. AFCS: Select tariff (1–15), apply multiple injury rules, add GIP
3. WPS: Percentage disablement, note apportionment
4. Output: "AFCS Tariff [L] (reason) [±GIP]" or "WPS [X%] (reason)."

### US 38 CFR  
1. Rate by appropriate Diagnostic Code
2. Apply Combined Ratings Table
3. Avoid pyramiding (overlap)
4. Output: "[X%] under DC(s) [...], rationale (1 line)."

## Follow-up Capabilities
- **Bracketing overlays**: Side-by-side comparison (current vs prior)
- **PCT math walks**: Full calculation transparency  
- **Targeted re-scoring**: Update single table for hypothetical changes
- **Descriptor audits**: List all table references and exact text used
